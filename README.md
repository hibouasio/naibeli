hello, welcome to my github. im just going to put a few dni/ints and what you need to know about me before interacting if you choose so
i am 19, i go by he/they but im fine with anything other than she/her and feminine terms.
you can call me eli or luce-preferably eli. i main seer on idv and i just got back into ranking after a year. proud nightowl owner
you can find me on tiktok/twitter/insta/pinterest as hibouasio-i used to go by naibburger and fangcrunch.

DNI || 
i am heavily into naibeli and it is a source of comfort, i will choose to ignore or hide other ships, especially nortnaib/jacknaib/aeseli/hasteli as they all kinda repulse me and make me uncomfortable.
i believe fiction affects reality, therefor if you are profic/darkship or whatever the fuck, disrespectfully do not interact.
norton ponies unless friends, im sorry....especially the katamy moon ones... tapping my chin
basic dni criteria of course.
ages 17 or younger, mutuals is fine-dont expect me to reply to you 24/7
i do not believe in the tt/td discourse and i think ur chronically online if you get upset over being touched on pt.
you have any issues with my friends, dont bring it to me unless its serious.
feminization of eli clark, i see myself in him (NOT AS A 'IRL'.) and im trans, so its really uncomfortable for me.
anyone affiliated with my exes/ex friends if yk who they are/ are coming from them.

INT ||
